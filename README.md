LambdaPiPlus extends the language LambdaPi, from
["A Tutorial Implementation of a Dependently Typed Lambda Calculus."](https://www.andres-loeh.de/LambdaPi/).
The language has been extended with Dependent Pairs and metavariables, in place of implicit arguments.
The unification algorithm used is adapted from
["A tutorial implementation of dynamic pattern unification"](http://adam.gundry.co.uk/pub/pattern-unify/).
